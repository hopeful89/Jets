This is a console project.  To run in eclipse please use the run button.

* In order to use the load command I have included a "jets2.txt"

### Lessons Learned

I learned that I really enjoy the use of inheritance and polymorphism.  I really enjoyed this project and I got very familiar with the debugger. Some of the biggest hurdles for me in this project was staying aware of visibility and keeping my class abstraction simple. I also learned some limitations of Iterator use.
