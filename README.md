### Lessons Learned

I learned that I really enjoy the use of inheritance and polymorphism.  I really enjoyed this project and I got very familiar with the debugger. Some of the biggest hurdles for me in this project was staying aware of visibility and keeping my class abstraction simple. I also learned some limitations of Iterator use.
